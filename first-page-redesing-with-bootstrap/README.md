# first-page-redesing-with-bootstrap
We will redesign this site with Bootstrap.


# Hi today we redesing our first https://github.com/atakbeso/firstcss-makeup site with bootstrap.
## My first Bootstrap project for www.patika.dev

### Lets Start.

## What we need to do?

    

     You can take the HTML part from the previous assignment, but we recommend that you do it from the beginning.
     Edit the menu in bold. You can also give a background color if you want.
     Put a jumbotron on the homepage and write a description of your content.
     Change the background color with #E9ECEF.
     Use the card structure on our products page.
     Use the card structure you use in the grid system.
     Note that the product card sizes are exactly the same.
     Include the About Us page in a card structure.
     Take a good look at the Bootstrap Documentation and try to experiment with different elements.
